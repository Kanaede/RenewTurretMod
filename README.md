This mod is mostly just turrets. It's just me creating random ideas that pop into my head.

Help star this mod so that it develops more.
The PC I used to make this mod is very slow so hopefully there is money to upgrade it, because I love making mods like this.

Give suggestions like Items, Liquids and Factories when there is some free time maybe I can add them.

****Those who want to translate can also contribute to making this mod.****
For now, only Default and Indonesian are available.
